## How to run the Project

* First run all the commands written in Commands.txt sequentially except the last command

* Then Upload this ![FILE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wM8bH7v89wVGA4T1s7ToXbo-odOJY8oB/view?usp=drive_link) in the deep_sort_pytorch\deep_sort\deep\checkpoint

* Now, If you want to test for live camera run 
### python detect_sort.py --weights yolov5s.pt  --img 640  --source 0 
* Otherwise you can run last command as it is.
